### Exercise 2 - Counting words.

Implement the `count` method so that given an input string, it returns the following to the user:

* The total number of words in the file
* The total occurances of each type of word, **sorted by the most occuring and in alphabetical order**

Do NOT modify the input string. 

Case should be disregarded. In other words, "The" and "the" should be treated as the same word. 

#### Example

If the input string contains:

```
The eager and hungry dog jumped over the fence...and into the garbage.
```

Then the program would output:

```
Total: 13
By Character:
the: 3
and: 2
dog: 1
eager: 1
fence: 1
garbage: 1
hungry: 1
into: 1
jumped: 1
over: 1
```
